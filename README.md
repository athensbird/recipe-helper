Project Name: Recipe Master

Have you ever opened your refrigerator multiple times and closed 5 seconds later without doing a thing? Yes, we had! Sometimes you just don't know what to cook even though you have so many ingredients. Recipe Master is a tool to create delicious recipes with the ingredients you have. Add as many ingredients as you want and let the tool work for you! Also, you can save your favorite recipes with just a click and come back whenever you want!	
At the back-end, we used node.js to build the server. Html, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, and JavaScript was our technologies on the front-end!
