Project Name: Recipe Master

Team Members: Emrah, Mark, Kumuda, Veronica

Have you ever opened your refrigerator multiple times and closed 5 seconds later without doing a thing? Yes, we all did! Sometimes you just don't know what to cook even though you have so many stuff in your refrigerator. Recipe Master is a tool to create delicious recipes with the ingredients you have. Add as many ingredients as you want and watch the magic! Also, you can save your favorite recipes with just a click and come back whenever you want!	

At the back-end, we used Node.js to build the server and implemented RESTful APIs. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, and JavaScript are our technologies on the front-end!
